Zhang, 40 years old, with over 10 years of experience of advanced software sales to large businesses in China, has previously been in charge of operations and growth of foreign corporations in China, including working as sales manager for HP Software in Shanghai. Zhang has an engineering degree in computer science from the prestigious Jiao Tong University in Xi'an. The China-based organization will continue to grow, initially with the recruitment of engineers for close customer support. The goal is to expand Imint's China office by 1-2 more people during 2016, in order to meet the interest the company is receiving. Andreas Lifvendahl, CEO, was on site to welcome Zhang.

Lifvendahl commented:

>David Zhang is a great find for us, and we can now significantly accelerate the work regarding local customer relations as well as building up a technical sales supporting organization here in China.

David Zhang added:

>Working for Imint is going to be a joy. I am already aware that it will be a hectic time. I was drawn to the position because Imint has such a strong vision and determination and am grateful for being a key player for continued growth.
