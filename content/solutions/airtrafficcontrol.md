Today, civilian air traffic is monitored by air traffic controllers performing visual observations from towers. However, air traffic control is becoming more and more reliant on video feeds. Airports see more and more cameras being installed not only for traffic control, but also for security and perimeter protection purposes.

New technology and applications thereof are making it possible to concentrate ATC to a centralized and possibly remote location. Airplanes are then monitored via computer screens. Unfortunately, weather and video visibility are not always favorable.

VidhanceÂ® improves the video feed received at the remote traffic control by addressing weather effects such as fog, mist, uneven illumination etc. It also provides other video analytic functions, such as object tracking.

All of this gives flight directors full access to sensors, illumination, aerial data and other flight direction tools just as if they were on location in the local flight tower.
