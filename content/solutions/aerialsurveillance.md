Video from unmanned aerial systems can often be affected by disturbances such as uncontrollable movements, vibration, weather conditions, and more. Despite this, video streams of high quality are needed, where stabilization can be play a major part.

The VidhanceÂ® technology addresses these kinds of issues and provides an improved, real-time video stream to the viewer inside a ground control station or at a remote video terminal.

This is something we have had experience with ever since 2009. Our products have since the beginning been developed in connection with customers in several different demanding industries.
