# Increase the dynamic range of video in real-time

To increase contrast and visibility in all areas of the frame, is much more complex in running video than for photos. The image processing algorithms need to be adaptive and clever, in order to produce a result without borders or flickering effects, while the dynamics of the scene, such as illumination, constantly changes.

Vidhance algorithms do this in real-time by identifying the different regions in a scene, with different illumination and chromatic properties, and increasing contrast where needed. Vidhance then smoothly blend borders between these regions, so that the overall frame is smooth. 

Vidhance only needs one frame for the analysis, but part of the secret is the temporal metadata that is extracted. The algorithms keep knowledge on areas, intensity, etc. to ensure smoothness over time. 

# The result is a video where scenes look more naturally in the real sense, close to the true vivid experience of a scene.  

Vidhance Adaptive Regional Contrast Optimization could be a good alternative to HDR solutions, and if an HDR solution is in place, our solution would be a boost to it. 

# Vidhance Adaptive Regional Contrast Optimization is an all-software solution, that does not require any specific camera interface – it will process frame by frame as delivered from the camera. 

Below you can watch some examples of how Vidhance Contrast Optimization works:
