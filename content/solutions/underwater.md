Remote-controlled underwater robots have become an essential tool in various deep sea operations. Safe control of these types of systems with high accuracy requires stabilized video streams of good quality.

Vidhance® can in real time reduce the effects of uneven illumination and improve visibility in murky waters by applying a combination of both regional and global contrast optimization.

Since all video processing take place in software, there is no need for increased complexity in the deployed hardware. It can instead focus on just delivering video - Vidhance® takes care of the rest.
