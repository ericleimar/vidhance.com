# Cut away excess and make the result interesting 

People often film far too long sequences, which results in boring videos. When professionals make films they keep only a portion. Because the average consumer neither has access to an editing board, nor the time to post-edit the videos, they are unfortunately kept as they are.

## The result is unengaging videos that take up far too much space on our memory. 

Vidhance Auto Curate will solve this. This tool will in seconds let you create videos containing only the most interesting parts. Based on both measured motion and video quality, Vidhance Auto Curate will suggest what segments to cut away and what to keep. 

## You will instantaneously have a short and engaging video.

This feature is not yet implemented and we are looking for lead partners to create a top-notch on-the-go editing tool. We are not experts in front-end development and UI, but maybe you are? We have the technology and expertise to build this together with partners with high front-end experience. Please contact us if you believe that you are one of those. 

Since people want to share videos with each other more and more this has the potential to become a feature highly sought-after by users all over the world.

Below you can watch a video showing how Vidhance Auto Curate could work in the future:
