High-quality video files still consume a relatively large amount of storage space. With stabilized and enhanced video, the small unnecessary changes from frame to frame that otherwise occur in recorded video are minimized.

This allows video compression algorithms to more easily minimize the file size and bandwidth required to store or transfer video files.

In turn this improves communication with, and storage of, video in small devices with limited storage space - such as smartphones. At the same time, video quality is dramatically improved in live scenarios such as video conferencing tools, and all private video recordings.
