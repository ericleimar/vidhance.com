Remote controlled robots, or unmanned ground vehicles, used on missions such as bomb defusal or search and rescue can suffer problems with visual disturbances affecting the video feed.

VidhanceÂ® improves the video where weather conditions, smoke, vibrations, and artificial illumination etc. impair visibility, and makes it easier for the operator to reduce the risk of missing crucial details.
