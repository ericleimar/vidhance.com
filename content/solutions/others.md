# Air Traffic Management

Today, civilian air traffic is monitored by air traffic controllers performing visual observations from towers. However, air traffic control is becoming more and more reliant on video feeds. Airports see more and more cameras being installed not only for traffic control, but also for security and perimeter protection purposes.

New technology and applications thereof are making it possible to concentrate ATC to a centralized and possibly remote location. Airplanes are then monitored via computer screens. Unfortunately, weather and video visibility are not always favorable.

Vidhance® improves the video feed received at the remote traffic control by addressing weather effects such as fog, mist, uneven illumination etc. It also provides other video analytic functions, such as object tracking.

All of this gives flight directors full access to sensors, illumination, aerial data and other flight direction tools just as if they were on location in the local flight tower.

# Aerial Surveillance and UAS

Video from unmanned aerial systems can often be affected by disturbances such as uncontrollable movements, vibration, weather conditions, and more. Despite this, video streams of high quality are needed, where stabilization can be play a major part.

The Vidhance® technology addresses these kinds of issues and provides an improved, real-time video stream to the viewer inside a ground control station or at a remote video terminal.

This is something we have had experience with ever since 2009. Our products have since the beginning been developed in connection with customers in several different demanding industries.

# Underwater

Remote-controlled underwater robots have become an essential tool in various deep sea operations. Safe control of these types of systems with high accuracy requires stabilized video streams of good quality.

Vidhance® can in real time reduce the effects of uneven illumination and improve visibility in murky waters by applying a combination of both regional and global contrast optimization.

Since all video processing take place in software, there is no need for increased complexity in the deployed hardware. It can instead focus on just delivering video - Vidhance® takes care of the rest.

# Ground Vehicles, UGVs, and Robots
{{<img src="/solutions/robots/robotExplosiveDisposal.png" class="float-right half-width">}}

Remote controlled robots, or unmanned ground vehicles, used on missions such as bomb defusal or search and rescue can suffer problems with visual disturbances affecting the video feed.

Vidhance® improves the video where weather conditions, smoke, vibrations, and artificial illumination etc. impair visibility, and makes it easier for the operator to reduce the risk of missing crucial details. <!--more-->
