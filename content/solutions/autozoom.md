When professionals create cinematic videos, they use zooming and panning. But everyone knows that using the digital zoom on a smartphone while recording is near useless. 

With Vidhance Autozoom enabled in your phone, zooming and panning will happen automatically and smoothly. The video zooms both in and out by itself, depending on how the object is moving. 

# You will instantly get engaging videos for immediate sharing on social media.

# The complete solution of Live Autozoom is built up of advanced real-time algorithms and includes modules such as:

- Object Tracker
- Object Sizer
- Background Stabilizer
- Object Stabilizer
- Smooth Zoom In and Zoom Out
- Motion-in-motion Detection - to identify movement in a video while the camera itself is moving
- Smart Frame Composition - to correctly position the object in the frame
- Object Refind - when the object disappears and reappears in the scene
- Application Specific Integration

# Really easy for the integrator and the end-user:

The integrator only needs to focus on Video Capture and Coding (OS) and the User Interface. The user just has to focus on following the object. 

# Vidhance takes care of the rest!
